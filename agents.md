You are a Senior ML Engineer specializing in recommendation systems on Google Cloud Platform. Design and implement a revenue-optimizing batch recommender system for large ecommerce website C2C marketplace.
## BUSINESS CONTEXT
Mercari is a C2C marketplace (similar to eBay in Japan) where users buy and sell items. Goal: Predict the next item a user will purchase to maximize revenue through improved conversion rates.
## TECHNICAL ENVIRONMENT
- Platform: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Data Source: BigQuery tables (users, items, item_category)
- Development: bigquery and Google Colab notebooks in python
- Processing: Batch processing (weekly updates acceptable)
- Scale: High volume data
## DATA ASSETS
Available Tables:
- users - User profiles and metadata
- items - Product catalog with features
- item_category - Category hierarchies and attributes
User Behavior Signals:
- Purchase history (recent items bought)
- Search queries and viewed items
- Liked/favorited items
- Popular/trending items interaction
## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
### Phase 1: Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering
1. BigQuery Analysis:
   - Audit existing table schemas and data quality
   - Create user behavior aggregation queries
   - Build item similarity and popularity metrics
   - Design feature engineering pipeline for batch processing
2. Feature Sets to Create:
   - User purchase patterns (recency, frequency, category preferences)
   - Item features (price, category, popularity scores, seasonal trends)
   - Interaction features (user-item affinity, collaborative signals)
   - Time-based features (trending items, seasonal patterns)
### Phase 2: Model Architecture
1. Hybrid Recommendation Approach:
   - Collaborative filtering for user-item interactions
   - Content-based filtering for item similarities
   - Matrix factorization for latent features
   - Consider deep learning (Neural CF) for complex patterns
2. Revenue Optimization:
   - Weight recommendations by item price and profit margins
   - Factor in conversion probability and user purchase power
   - Include inventory and seller reliability metrics
### Phase 3: Implementation & Evaluation
1. Model Training Pipeline:
   - Design train/validation/test splits with temporal considerations
   - Implement model training in Colab with BigQuery integration
   - Create batch scoring pipeline for daily recommendations
2. Evaluation Framework:
   - Primary: Revenue per user (RPU) and conversion rate
   - Secondary: Click-through rate, engagement metrics
   - A/B testing framework design for production validation
## DELIVERABLES EXPECTED
1. Data exploration notebook with BigQuery analysis and feature engineering
2. Model training notebook with multiple algorithm comparisons
3. Batch scoring pipeline for generating daily recommendations
4. Performance evaluation report with revenue impact projections
5. Production deployment plan for GCP infrastructure
## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Optimize for batch processing efficiency (cost-conscious BigQuery usage)
- Handle high-volume data with appropriate sampling strategies
- Ensure scalable architecture for future real-time implementation
- Maintain explainable recommendations for business stakeholders
Please provide step-by-step implementation starting with data exploration and feature engineering, including specific BigQuery SQL queries and Python code for Colab execution.
